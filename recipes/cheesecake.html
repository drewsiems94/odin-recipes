    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Cheesecake is a sweet dessert 
    consisting of one or more layers. The 
    main, and thickest, layer consists of a 
    mixture of a soft, fresh cheese 
    (typically cottage cheese, cream cheese 
    or ricotta), eggs, and sugar. If there 
    is a bottom layer, it most often 
    consists of a crust or base made from 
    crushed cookies (or digestive biscuits),
    graham crackers, pastry, or sometimes 
    sponge cake.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Graham cracker crumbs</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Cream cheese</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Lemon juice</li>
        <li>Vanilla</li>
        <li>Heavy cream</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine cookie crumbs and melted 
        butter in a small bowl, then stir in 
        a pinch of salt to taste. Sprinkle 
        into a 9-inch tart pan or pie plate, 
        spread into an even layer, then 
        compress firmly with a flat-bottomed 
        drinking glass or measuring cup; this 
        will naturally push the crumbs up 
        the sides of the pan. Keep pressing 
        until the crumbs are in a compact, 
        even layer across the bottom and sides 
        of the pan. Refrigerate until 
        needed. (The crust can be made and 
        held for a day or two if wrapped in 
        plastic.)</li>
        <li>Combine cream cheese, sugar, 
        lemon juice, vanilla, and salt in 
        the bowl of a stand mixer fitted 
        with a paddle attachment. Mix at 
        low speed to form a thick paste, 
        then increase to medium speed until 
        soft and smooth.</li>
        <li>Scrape bowl and beater with a 
        flexible spatula, then switch to 
        the whisk attachment and pour in 
        cream. Mix at low speed to combine, 
        then increase to high and whip until 
        the mixture can hold stiff peaks, 3 
        to 5 minutes depending on the 
        horsepower of your mixer.</li>
        <li>Scrape filling into prepared 
        crust and spread into an even 
        layer, using the back of a spoon to 
        sculpt filling into swoops and 
        swirls. Cover with plastic and 
        refrigerate until the filling is 
        firm and cold, about 6 hours or to 
        an internal temperature of 40°F 
        (4°C).</li>
    </ol>
